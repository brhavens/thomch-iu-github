                <h2>URL Classification</h2>

                <br>

                <h3>Analytical Approaches and Justification</h3>

                <br>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Task:</b> Analyze data from PhishTank to assist with classifying URLs as malicious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Value:</b> Being able to identify the maliciousness of URLs can save individuals and organizations from making extremely costly mistakes. 
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Companies can use this intelligence to flag URLs as risky.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While it is ultimately up to the user to determine if they click a link, being able to provide a potential warning is extremely valuable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Potential Value: Identifying specific features from the URLs (ex: number of  symbols/digits/etc.) to see if they can assist with accuracy of predictions. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Additions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The current dataset contains approximately 8,000 malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the end goal being to classify if a URL is malicious, additional data needs to be added with valid/safe URLs to help train the model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Moz.com provides a CSV of some of the most popular websites.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The dataset is limited to 500 records.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                                <img src="/thomch-iu-github/assets/images/Moz-Sample-Sites.png" alt="Moz.com Sample Websites" />
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h4>Feature Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The data provided by PhishTank is very valuable; however, it lacks detailed information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two of the provided columns include "verified" and "online" but they will always be "yes" for our data set due to the nature of PhishTank's file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the "target" column has a handful of records relating to the financial industry, the vast majority is classified as "Other".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">

                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Feature Additions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To assist with the classification model, post-processing was performed on the data to provide additional features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The following columns were added to the dataset:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b><i>is_malicious</i></b> = Indicates if a URL is malicious

                    <li>
                        After the post-processing, the final dataset includes a combination of 500 safe URLs and approximately 8,000 malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The attributes in the dataset are:
