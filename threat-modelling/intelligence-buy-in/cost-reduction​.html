                <li>The abilities of artificial intelligence can help reduce the average cost of data breaching:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active AI that prevents active breaching, fraud, etc.</li>
                        <li>Constant analysis of payment data from consumers</li>
                        <li>Finds inconsistency in big data quickly
                            <ul>
                                <li>The more data the more accurate
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Better predictions</li>
                                        <li>Can differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transaction with high precision</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>With the vast abilities of AI, the objective of the technology is to diminish breaching, hacking, etc. as much as possible.  Investing in AI company wide helps reduce the potential costs of being breached.  If there is somehow data leakage, breaching, etc. it would be meniscal to the potential loss of not having AI as cybersecurity.</li>
